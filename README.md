# PodSense: Podcast SummarizerüéôÔ∏è
Course project for [Uplimit: Building AI Products with OpenAI](https://uplimit.com/course/building-ai-products-with-openai)

## Problem statement

Podcasts are a great way to gain insights into different industries and technologies, as well as to learn from the lived experience of people all over the world. But there is limited time, and we end up listening to only some of them!

Many popular podcasts release 1‚Äì2 episodes a week, and it's hard to identify an episode that would appeal to each person. While many episodes provide show notes, additional links, and timestamps, they are not always helpful in understanding the unique aspects of the episode and providing a strong reason for each person to want to listen to it!

## Solution

A product that generates a newsletter every week that summarizes favorite podcasts for each person so that they can then choose which ones to listen to!

1. Use a large language model from OpenAI to build the information extraction functionality, paired with a speech-to-text model for transcribing the podcast.
2. Use a simple cloud deployment provider to easily convert the information extraction function to run on demand ‚Äì This would be the app backend.
3. Use ChatGPT from OpenAI as your coding assistant to create and deploy a front-end that allows users to experience the end-to-end functionality.
